# Python Project 2

This repository serves as a template for Python projects, providing a structure and examples to kickstart my development process. This template offers me best practices and common patterns to follow thus saving  development time.

This repository will be a continuation of my previous repository ['Python-Project'](https://github.com/RATHOD-SHUBHAM/Python-Projects).


## Python Subprocess

- Automating system tasks.
- Running command-line tools.
- Running external executables.
- Running scripts as background processes.
- Running scripts with non-Python interpreter.
- Parallel processing.

** Running shell commands.
** Running Python scripts.
** Running Python code directly from a function.
** Using the check argument.


## Pipe
A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel that connects one process's standard output to another's standard input. A pipe can connect the output of one command to the input of another, allowing the output of the first command to be used as input to the second command.
